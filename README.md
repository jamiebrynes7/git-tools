# Git Tools

This repository contains the tools I had [previously written in Python](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/useful-scripts), translated to Rust.

## Branch Selector

This is a simple tool for quicking swapping branches. 

## Clean Branches

This is a tool for cleaning branches by parsing the pruned remote branches and removing the local equivalents.
